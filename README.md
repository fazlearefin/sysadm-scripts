* hostid.sh

#hostid.sh
This script lets you create your hostid of your choice on the host. You can either provide the hostid you want or you can choose to write the current hostid to `/etc/hosts`. Writing the hostid to `/etc/hosts` makes sure your hosid remains the same, say, even when you change your ip address.

The `hostid` command lets you see the current hostid.
